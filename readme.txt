Shows attachments directly on the post edit screen. Also gives you full control over image edit options.

== Description ==

I very often use WordPress as a CMS for clients like artists or photographers, who want to present a big amount of media files on their websites. Most of the time, the media files actually are the very center of these websites.

To reflect this focus on media files in the admin area, I developed the plugin "Inline Attachments". It adds a Meta Box to the post edit screen, that holds the media-uploads panel inside an iframe. If no Media Files are attached to a post yet, it shows the upload tab, otherwise it shows the list of attached media files.

In the plugin settings, you can select all post types, where the Inline Attachments Meta Box should be displayed, and you can specify a name for each (e.g. ”Photographs“ or ”Images“). Default is ”Media Files“.

Another thing with mainly media-driven websites is, that you normally don't write a text post and put some images into the text flow. Because of this, you wouldn't need the options for Image Size, Alignment, Link URL and so on in the attachment screen. With Inline Attachments, you can easily select which options should be visible to the admin for editing media files.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder 'inline-attachments' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the plugin settings page called “Inline Attachments” and select the post types you want to have it activated for. Also select all the fields you want to enable for media editing.
3. Go to the post edit sceen, and here it is, your inline attachments meta box.
